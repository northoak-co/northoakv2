# NorthOak SEO/AEO Plan

Working document. Check off items as they ship. Drafted 2026-05-07 after benchmarking against venn.ca and validating against 2025–2026 evidence on AI citation behavior, SPA crawler rendering, and B2B-services content patterns.

---

## Context

**Current state:** Vite + React Router v6 SPA, client-side rendered, deployed on Vercel with `vercel.json` rewriting every route to `index.html`. ~10 routes total. No per-route meta, no structured data, no sitemap, no FAQ, no blog, no case studies. `index.html` still ships Lovable boilerplate (`author=Lovable`, `twitter:site=@Lovable`).

**Single biggest problem:** GPTBot, ClaudeBot, PerplexityBot, OAI-SearchBot, and AppleBot do not execute JavaScript (confirmed by Vercel's 1.3B-fetch analysis and ALM Corp's 66B-fetch analysis). The site is functionally invisible to AI engines today. Slack, Discord, iMessage, LinkedIn link previews are also broken for the same reason.

**Strategy:** Fix the rendering foundation first, then build commercial-intent content (role pages, comparison pages, named case studies). Skip the blog cadence — it doesn't drive pipeline in this category. Allocate real effort to off-site presence (G2, listicles, podcasts, Reddit), which correlates with AI citation more strongly than backlinks (r=0.664 vs r=0.295, Ahrefs 75K-brand study).

## Competitive parity framework

Benchmark drafted 2026-05-07 after auditing four direct competitors: getmagic.com, supportninja.com, growthassistant.com, athena.com. The framework defines what NorthOak must have to be *credible* in this category (table stakes) and where to invest to *stand out* (differentiator picks). Every item below is tracked against an existing P0/P1/P2 task or flagged as a new addition.

### What each competitor is best at (one line)

- **Magic** — scale + breadth (40+ pages, 13+ industry verticals) and an AI-augmentation story (Magic AI). Hero is generic; pricing is hidden.
- **SupportNinja** — risk-conscious / regulated buyers. Strongest compliance posture of the four (SOC 2 Type 2, PCI-DSS 4, HIPAA, GDPR), CEO video, named "Privacy-First" pillar.
- **GrowthAssistant** — *the most copy-pasteable conversion stack of the four.* Published price ($3,500/mo, month-to-month), free replacements anytime, named talent profile cards with achievements, buyer-matched CMO/CRO testimonials, founder-led origin story (Jesse Pujji / Ampush). If we're going to study one site line-by-line, it's this one.
- **Athena** — emotional/benefit-led brand for founders and execs. $3,000/mo published. Cinematic narrative testimonials. Compliance posture is weakest of the four despite the Stripe/Goldman/Sequoia logos.

### Table stakes — what every credible competitor has

NorthOak must check every box below to be considered seriously. Status reflects what's already shipped, what's tracked elsewhere in this plan, and what's net-new.

| # | Item | Status | Tracked in |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Named-client logo wall (≥5 recognizable buyers) | ✅ have | 20 logos already on homepage |
| 2 | 3+ case studies with hard metrics on dedicated URLs | ⏳ planned | P2 #14 |
| 3 | 5+ testimonials with full name, title, company, photo | ⏳ planned | P1 #10 (homepage), expand in P2 |
| 4 | Multiple role pages (≥5) | ✅ have | 6 role pages, parity with category |
| 5 | "How It Works" page (3-step process, vetting funnel, replacement guarantee) | ❌ new | **Added to P1 below** |
| 6 | Pricing signal — published rate or transparent "starts at $X" | ⚠️ pending | Decision still open (see Decisions section) |
| 7 | Comparison/positioning artifact (vs in-house, vs freelance, vs BPO) | ⏳ planned | P1 #8 (3 `/vs/` pages) |
| 8 | Guarantee statement on home + role pages (free replacement, etc.) | ❌ new | **Added to P1 below** |
| 9 | `/about` page with founder/leadership face + bios | ⏳ planned | P1 #12 |
| 10 | Substantive trust artifact (security page, founder origin, named methodology) | ⏳ planned | P1 #13 (`/security`) + P2 differentiator below |

### Differentiator picks — where NorthOak invests to stand out

Pick **two or three**, not all. Spreading thin matches the bar; depth wins.

1. **Pricing transparency that beats Magic + SupportNinja, equals GrowthAssistant.** Publish a real monthly price + free-replacement guarantee on `/pricing`. Magic ($0 until you hire) and SupportNinja (3 named tiers, no dollars) are vague; GA and Athena look the most confident specifically because they publish. Tracked in Decisions section.
2. **One substantive trust artifact done well.** SupportNinja owns compliance, GA owns founder-origin, Magic owns AI. NorthOak should pick *one* and lead with it:
   - **Compliance** (SOC 2 Type II current or in-progress) — biggest commercial wedge for selling to regulated mid-market. Highest lift, highest payoff. Tracked in P1 #13 + Decisions.
   - **Founder origin story** — GA's Jesse Pujji / Ampush angle is the single most efficient trust move on any of the four sites. Cheap; just needs founder time. Tracked in P1 #12.
3. **Named structural concept.** Every competitor has one (Magic's "Magic Match" + "Magic 24/7", SupportNinja's "MaaS / TaaS", GA's "First-Match Rate", Athena's "compounding partnership"). It gives sales something to point at and reporters something to cite. NorthOak does not have one yet — **added to P2 below**.
4. **Named AI-augmentation story.** Every competitor has one (Magic AI, NinjaAI, GAI). Becoming table-stakes-adjacent — needs a named version within 6 months, even if the underlying capability is light. **Added to P2 below.**

### What to deliberately skip (category over-investments)

- **13+ industry vertical pages (Magic-style).** NorthOak ships 2 in P2, only paired with case studies. Programmatic grids without authority are penalized.
- **Refer-a-friend incentive program (Magic).** Low-ROI mechanic for B2B services with long sales cycles.
- **Email-gated lead magnets early (SupportNinja's 2026 CX Outsourcing Report).** Build trust through ungated case studies first; gating belongs to companies with brand authority to trade for the email.

### Honest scoring of NorthOak today vs the four

- **Stronger than Athena on:** logo wall caliber (NorthOak's 20 logos compete with Athena's), role-page breadth.
- **Stronger than nobody on:** trust artifacts, conversion clarity, founder visibility, content depth.
- **Closing the gap is mostly already in the plan.** P1 (testimonials, comparison pages, /about, /security, calculator) plus P2 (case studies + verticals) gets us to credible parity. The two new items below are the only structural gaps the framework surfaced.

---

## What we explicitly are NOT doing (and why)

- **Migrating to Next.js.** App Router would force `"use client"` on every framer-motion component, hydration boundaries on Tanstack Query, and `@supabase/ssr`. Pure overhead for ~10 routes.
- **Adding `llms.txt`.** 2025 server-log audits confirm no major AI engine fetches it. Cargo cult.
- **Listing AI bots in robots.txt as `Allow:`.** Allowing isn't a positive signal — it's just the absence of a block. Default permissive is correct.
- **Publishing 2 blog posts/week.** AI citation evidence rewards short structured passages and tables, not 1500-word filler. B2B services category evidence shows generic blogs don't drive pipeline.
- **Programmatic role × industry grids.** Risks thin-content penalties without site authority. Revisit after 50+ pages of real content.
- **`Review` JSON-LD.** Skip until we have real, named, attributed testimonials to mark up.
- **A 13+ industry-page sprawl** (Magic-style). 2 verticals max in P2, paired with case studies.
- **Refer-a-friend program** and **early email-gated lead magnets**. Both are category over-investments for our stage.

## P0 — Foundation (this week)

Highest-leverage technical work. Unlocks everything in P1.

- [x] **Migrate to React Router v7 framework mode with `prerender: true`** *(2026-05-07, branch `seo/rr-v7-migration`)*
  - Swapped `react-router-dom@6` for `react-router@7` + `@react-router/dev` + `@react-router/node` + `@react-router/serve`
  - Added `react-router.config.ts` with `ssr: false, prerender: true, appDirectory: "src"` so we keep the existing `src/` layout instead of reorganizing under `app/`
  - Replaced `vite.config.ts`'s `react()` plugin with `reactRouter()`; package scripts use `react-router build` / `react-router dev` (Vite alone doesn't trigger the prerender step)
  - Created `src/root.tsx` (HTML shell + `<Meta>`/`<Links>`/`<Outlet>`/`<Scripts>`/`<ScrollRestoration>`, providers wrapping `<Outlet>`, ErrorBoundary) and `src/routes.ts` (config-based routes pointing at the existing `src/pages/*`)
  - Updated all 12 component imports from `react-router-dom` → `react-router`
  - Deleted: `index.html`, `src/main.tsx`, `src/App.tsx`, `src/components/ScrollToTop.tsx` (replaced by RR v7's built-in `<ScrollRestoration>`)
  - Replaced the SPA-only `vercel.json` rewrite with `outputDirectory: "build/client"` + `cleanUrls: true`
  - Did NOT install `@vercel/react-router` — only needed when `ssr: true`; with `ssr: false + prerender: true` the output is plain static HTML that Vercel serves natively
  - **Verified:** build emits real HTML for all 12 routes; `bun run dev` serves each route with populated `<head>` + body content; no remaining `react-router-dom` imports; `tsc` clean
- [x] **Per-route meta via RR v7 `meta` export** *(2026-05-07)* — added `src/lib/seo.ts` with a `pageMeta()` helper; every page module now exports `meta = () => pageMeta({...})` with its own title, description, canonical URL, OG and Twitter cards. All 12 routes verified to emit unique `<title>` and canonical in prerendered HTML.
- [x] **Strip Lovable boilerplate from `index.html`** *(2026-05-07)*
  - Removed `<meta name="author" content="Lovable" />` and `<meta name="twitter:site" content="@Lovable" />`
  - Removed leftover TODO comments and the 28 stray blank lines between meta tags
  - Replaced the `storage.googleapis.com/gpt-engineer-file-uploads/...` OG image with `https://northoak.com/og-image.png` (placeholder logo — see open items below)
  - Tightened title and description with category keywords ("Operations Outsourcing for High-Growth Teams"); added `og:url`, `og:site_name`, `<link rel="canonical">`
- [x] **Generate `sitemap.xml` at build time** *(2026-05-07)* — `scripts/generate-sitemap.ts` walks `build/client/` for prerendered `index.html` files and emits `build/client/sitemap.xml`; wired up as a `postbuild` script so the sitemap always reflects what was actually shipped (no separate route list to keep in sync). 12 URLs in the current sitemap. `__spa-fallback.html` excluded.
- [x] **Update `robots.txt`** *(2026-05-07)* — collapsed redundant per-bot `Allow:` blocks down to a single default-allow + `Sitemap: https://northoak.com/sitemap.xml`.
- [x] **JSON-LD on every page** *(2026-05-07)*
  - `Organization` (name, url, logo, description, contactPoint with sales email) — emitted on every page via `<script>` in `src/root.tsx`'s `Layout` (literal element so it survives child-route meta overrides)
  - `WebSite` — same approach. `SearchAction` not added because the site has no search; revisit if/when one ships.
  - `Service` (with `serviceType`, `provider`, `areaServed`) on each of the 6 role pages via `serviceSchema()` helper in `src/lib/seo.ts`
  - `BreadcrumbList` on each role page via `breadcrumbSchema()` helper
  - `sameAs` LinkedIn URL not added yet — see open items below for the LinkedIn URL gap.
- [x] **Fix two real bugs** *(2026-05-07)*
  - `Footer.tsx` — broken LinkedIn `href="#"` social-icon block removed (add back when LinkedIn URL is provided)
  - `Footer.tsx` — "View all" link to `/roles` (404) removed; the 5 individual role links remain

**P0 acceptance check:** `curl -A "GPTBot" https://northoak.com/roles/crm-management` returns the role page's actual content in the HTML body (not an empty `<div id="root">`). Slack/LinkedIn link unfurls show the correct title and OG image per route.

### Open items from completed P0 work

- ~~**OG image is a placeholder.**~~ *(Resolved 2026-05-07)* — replaced with a 1200×630 NorthOak team photo at `public/og-image.png` (324KB, optimized).
- ~~**LinkedIn URL needed.**~~ *(Resolved 2026-05-07)* — `https://www.linkedin.com/company/northoak`. Footer icon restored (with `target="_blank"` + `rel="noopener noreferrer"`); URL added to `Organization` JSON-LD `sameAs` in `src/root.tsx`.
- **Branch `seo/rr-v7-migration` not yet merged.** All P0 work is on this branch awaiting review + merge to `main`. Manual smoke checks recommended before deploy: every route at `bun run dev`, then `bun run build` and `bunx serve build/client` to confirm production output behaves the same.

## P1 — Content surface (next 2–3 weeks)

Build the bottom-of-funnel pages. Commercial-intent content drives almost all qualified traffic in this category; informational top-of-funnel converts at 0.1–0.5% vs ~7% for comparison/alternatives content (CXL, First Page Sage benchmarks).

- [ ] **Deepen each role page from ~150 to ~600–900 words**, structured for AI citation:
  - TL;DR answer in the first 60 words (front-loading captures 44% of LLM citations per Profound's analysis)
  - "What a [role] does day-to-day" — bulleted task list
  - "Tools they're proficient in" (HubSpot, Salesforce, QuickBooks, Zendesk, Gorgias, etc. — searched terms)
  - **Cost section** — comparison table "Domestic [role] vs NorthOak" (tables get 4.2× more LLM citations than prose)
  - "How fast you can hire" timeline
  - 5–6 role-specific FAQs at the bottom
  - Roles to update: CRM Management, Customer Support, HR Admin, Virtual Assistant, Finance & Accounting, Back Office Admin
- [ ] **Three comparison pages** (highest-cited content type per Profound's data — ~32.5% of AI citations)
  - [ ] `/vs/upwork-fiverr` — vetting, replacement, account management, payroll/compliance
  - [ ] `/vs/domestic-hire` — loaded cost, time-to-hire, flexibility (embeds the calculator from #11)
  - [ ] `/vs/traditional-bpo` — dedicated vs pooled, no minimums, smaller team
  - Each page: comparison table, FAQ section, `FAQPage` JSON-LD
  - Skip `vs Belay/Athena/Time Etc` for now — small sites don't win branded competitor SEO
- [ ] **Homepage FAQ section, 8–10 questions** wrapped with `FAQPage` JSON-LD
  - What is NorthOak?
  - How does NorthOak differ from Upwork/Fiverr/freelancers?
  - Where are NorthOak specialists based?
  - How fast can I hire?
  - What does it cost?
  - Who owns the work / IP?
  - How are specialists vetted?
  - What time zones do you cover?
  - How do contracts and termination work?
  - What roles do you not staff?
- [ ] **Three named, attributed testimonials on homepage** with role + company. We have 20 logos and zero quotes — easiest trust unlock available.
- [ ] **One calculator: "Loaded cost of a US hire vs NorthOak"**
  - Inputs: role + base salary
  - Output: fully-loaded domestic cost (benefits, taxes, PTO, equipment, recruiting cost) vs NorthOak monthly fee
  - Live on `/vs/domestic-hire`
  - Almost no competitor in this category has built this well
- [ ] **`/about` page** with founder names, photos, bios, LinkedIn links, where specialists are based, year founded. AI engines need an entity to attribute claims to. *(Parity item; also delivers on the differentiator pick if we lean into a founder-origin story like GrowthAssistant's Jesse Pujji / Ampush angle.)*
- [ ] **`/security` page** — SOC 2 status (current or roadmap), NDA/IP assignment language, data handling, device policy. Sales-cycle gate for mid-market deals. *(Differentiator opportunity — only SupportNinja has compliance badges across the four competitors.)*
- [ ] **`/how-it-works` page** *(parity gap surfaced by competitive review)* — 3-step process (intake → vetted match → embedded specialist), visualized vetting funnel ("top X% of applicants accepted"), match SLA (days to first interview), replacement guarantee. Every credible competitor has this page; NorthOak does not.
- [ ] **Guarantee statement on home + every role page** *(parity gap)* — visible above the fold somewhere. GrowthAssistant: *"If it's not a fit, we go back to work. Free, every time."* Magic: *"$0 until you hire."* Athena: replacement support. NorthOak needs its own one-line version. Drives conversion + closes a credibility gap that's free to fix.

## P2 — Trust + earned media (weeks 4–10)

Brand mentions correlate with AI citation at r=0.664 — strongest single factor in Ahrefs' 75K-brand study, ahead of backlinks (r=0.295) and DR (r=0.326). For a young brand this is leverage that on-site work alone can't replicate.

- [ ] **Case-study cadence: one named case study per month**
  - Format: client name (or pseudonym + industry/size), starting state, role staffed, KPIs (hours saved, $ saved, output volume), client quote
  - Aim: 6 in the first 6 months, pulled from the existing 20-logo wall
  - Each gets its own URL, JSON-LD, and is internally linked from the relevant role page and vertical page
- [ ] **Two vertical landing pages** — only the two with the strongest existing case studies
  - Likely candidates from current logo wall:
    - **E-commerce / DTC** (Italist, Verishop, Stylight, MyBestBrands, EGO, Hewi)
    - **SaaS / operations** (BlueJ, Venn, FlipGive, DOZR, Bonsai)
  - Each must embed a real case study from that vertical
- [ ] **Off-site presence — three bets**
  - [ ] G2 / Capterra listing under "BPO Services" or "Virtual Assistant Services"
  - [ ] Get on 3–5 existing "best [role] outsourcing companies" listicles (outreach to listicle authors)
  - [ ] One founder podcast appearance per quarter (Built to Sell, Operations with Sean Lane, etc.)
- [ ] **Reddit/Quora seeding** — 2–3 substantive answers/month in r/smallbusiness, r/startups, r/CustomerSuccess. NorthOak mentioned only when genuinely relevant. Perplexity especially weights Reddit citations.
- [ ] **Define and name a structural concept** *(differentiator pick from competitive review)*. Every credible competitor has one — Magic Match / Magic 24/7, SupportNinja's MaaS / TaaS, GrowthAssistant's First-Match Rate, Athena's compounding partnership. Goal: one named methodology or pod structure that sales can point at and reporters can cite. Document the choice on `/how-it-works`, then weave it across the homepage, comparison pages, and case studies.
- [ ] **Define and name an AI-augmentation story** *(differentiator pick)*. Every competitor has one (Magic AI, NinjaAI, GAI). Becoming table-stakes-adjacent. Even a light version — "every NorthOak specialist is trained on \[named tool/SOP\] and ships output reviewed by AI before delivery" — is enough at this stage. Skipping this for too long looks behind by 2026.

---

## P3 — After P0–P2 ship

- [ ] Submit sitemap to Google Search Console + Bing Webmaster Tools. Monitor coverage and which queries cite us.
- [ ] **Glossary section** (`/glossary/[term]`) — "BPO," "offshore staffing," "fractional operations," "loaded cost," "managed services vs staff augmentation," etc. Glossary/definitional pages are heavily cited by ChatGPT.
- [ ] **Consider a blog — only after ~6 case studies exist.** Cadence: 1 deep linkable asset per month, not 8 thin ones. Citation-friendly topics:
  - "[Role] cost in 2026" pricing posts
  - "[Tool A] vs [Tool B]" comparison posts
  - "How to onboard a [role]" SOPs

---

## Target sitemap after P0–P2

~18 pages, all bottom-of-funnel commercial intent:

- `/` (home)
- `/how-it-works`
- `/pricing`
- `/about`
- `/security`
- `/get-started`
- `/careers`
- `/roles/crm-management`
- `/roles/customer-support`
- `/roles/hr-admin`
- `/roles/virtual-assistant`
- `/roles/finance-accounting`
- `/roles/back-office-admin`
- `/vs/upwork-fiverr`
- `/vs/domestic-hire`
- `/vs/traditional-bpo`
- `/industries/ecommerce`
- `/industries/saas-startups`
- `/case-studies/[slug]` × 3+
- `/terms-of-service`, `/privacy-policy`

---

## Decisions still to make

- [x] ~~RR v7 vs Astro for the rendering migration~~ — picked RR v7 framework mode, shipped 2026-05-07.
- [ ] Pick the two verticals for P2 #2 — depends on which 2 case studies we can publish first.
- [ ] Decide whether to publish pricing on `/pricing` or keep it as a "Talk to us" funnel. Athena and Time Etc publish; Belay does not. Publishing filters out enterprise-only buyers; hiding filters out fast-moving SMB.
- [ ] SOC 2 status — is NorthOak SOC 2 Type II, in progress, or neither? Wording on `/security` depends on this.
- [x] ~~Provide the canonical NorthOak LinkedIn company URL.~~ *(2026-05-07: `https://www.linkedin.com/company/northoak`)*
- [x] ~~Provide a designed 1200×630 OG image.~~ *(2026-05-07: NorthOak team photo, 1200×630, 324KB)*
- [ ] **Pick 2 differentiators from the parity framework.** Which two of {pricing transparency, SOC 2 / compliance lead, founder origin story, named structural concept, named AI story} do we lead with? Other three become "table stakes; do them, don't lead with them."
- [ ] Define the actual guarantee statement (e.g., "Free replacement within 30 days, no questions asked"). Wording goes on home + role pages once decided.
